repartitioned 4gb sdram:

Disk /dev/sdc: 3.7 GiB, 3963617280 bytes, 7741440 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x00000000

Device     Boot Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sdc1        2048    4095    2048    1M cf unknown
/dev/sdc2        4096 7741439 7737344  3.7G  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)

this of course is USB-HDD, and I wanted a boot floppy. so I overwrote the
MBR and the rest of the first 1.44M of the 4GB SDRAM with ../test/b.img.

root@aspire:~# file -s /dev/sdc
/dev/sdc: DOS floppy 1440k, DOS/MBR hard disk boot sector

that still was recognized by the BIOS as USB-HDD. so then I downloaded
fdboot.img from freedos.org and overwrote the MBR yet again. this time:


t@aspire:~# file -s /dev/sdc
/dev/sdc: DOS/MBR boot sector, code offset 0x3c+2, OEM-ID "LINUX4.1", root entries 224, sectors 2880 (volumes <=32 MB) , sectors/FAT 9, sectors/track 18, serial number 0x44fa7fe3, label: "           ", FAT (12 bit), followed by FAT
